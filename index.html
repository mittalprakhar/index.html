                    <p>Hey there! I am Prakhar Mittal, currently 15 years old. I was born in a small town called Saharanpur in India. I am very passionate about solving challenges and I spend a lot of time working on my computer: surfing the Internet, watching videos, following my favourite topics, trying out new programming languages and making short films. 

                    <p>I have been learning the piano since I was seven and I also play for a pop band 'The Ensomniac Dreamers' since 2016. During my free time, I listen to songs, and play them on my piano, or compose my own music.

                    <p>In 2015, I co-founded robotics team 'High Voltage' when we participated in World Robot Olympiad. In the FIRST LEGO League season, I was introduced to the mechanical aspect of building a robot and I got the opportunity of interacting with people across the globe. Being a part of the STEM community helped me become a better leader and improved my problem identification and logical reasoning skills.

                    <p>The highlight of my journey in the field of robotics was when my team bounced back from a failed run to get a fullscore in the final run of WRO 2016. We finished second at the international event and bagged the Silver Medal for our country.

                    <p>The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition for young people. The 2016 season, Rap the Scrap, was held in Delhi, India in November 2016. The Indian chapter began from October, with the Delhi-NCR Regionals being the opening event of the season.
                        
                    <p>The 2016 Regular Junior High challenge 'Waste Sorting' required a robot to autonomously identify and locate the different types of wastes (denoted by cubes of different sizes and colours) found inside the house, and take them to their respective bins, to sort the waste. The challenge required locating the different bins available for sorting (also differentiated by colors and location), identifying different wastes available, and matching the wastes to their respective bins using an algorithm. Finally, to score points, the robot needed to pick the wastes, deposit them in the bins, and return to the start area.

                    <p>FIRST Tech Challenge is a global, robotics competition for students in grades 9-12. FTC teams are responsible for planning, building and programming their robots in a 3-month build period to compete in an alliance format against other teams. Teams are also required to make an 'Engineering Notebook' that documents their build season and experience.
                    
                    <p>Velocity Vortex, the 2016-17 edition of the FIRST Tech Challenge, required a robot to perform a variety of different tasks. The match began with an autonomous period, where the robots could only operate by pre-programmed instructions. The autonomous period was followed by a driver-controlled period, where points were awarded if the robot shot particles into the designated areas. Our robot featured a holonomic drivetrain for increased maneuverability, a flicker for quickly and effectively launching the particles and a mechanism for pressing the correct beacon buttons.
