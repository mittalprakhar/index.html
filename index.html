                    Hello! I am Prakhar Mittal, I was born in a town called Saharanpur in India, on 26th May 2002; and as you
                    might guess- I am 14 years old. I attend Delhi Public School, in Gurgaon, where I am living since the past eight
                    years. Since a young age, I enjoyed tackling challenges and had a passion for pursuing my interests. I spend 
                    quite a lot of time working on my computer: surfing the Internet, watching videos, following my favourite
                    topics, trying out new programming languages and making short films. <br><br>
                    I am told I excel in studies, even when I am always busy in pursuing my hobbies. I have been learning to <a href="https://pianistprakhar.weebly.com" target="_blank" style="color:#dcdcff">play
                    the piano</a> since I was seven, and as of now, am scheduled to appear for Trinity College London's Grade 7 Exam. In my free time, I listen to songs, and play them on my piano, or compose my own music using Logic Pro. Moreover, I love playing with my camera and learning fancy film-editing skills on Final Cut Pro. Web development is another one of my several interests. <br><br>
                    I like to work in groups and am good at planning and organizing the group. I am good at problem identification
                    and show quick logical understanding as well. These qualities, and my natural passion for programming,
                    introduced me to the world of STEM Education.<br><br>
                    I eventually became a part of Team HIGH VOLTAGE, which exposed me to the world of robotics. We participated in
                    the World Robot Olympiad 2015, which helped me to learn communication and teamworking skills. In the First Lego
                    League season, I was introduced to the mechanical aspect of building a robot, which was one sphere where I
                    originally lacked. FLL helped me open up by providing me opportunities of interacting with people across the
                    globe and express my opinions in front of others. <br><br>
                    The highlight of my life was when my team High Voltage bounced back from a failed run to get a fullscore in the three elimination runs, to finish 2nd (Silver Medal) in the internationals event of WRO India 2016.

                    The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition for young people. First held in 2004 in Singapore, it
                    now attracts more than 20,000 teams from nearly 60 countries. The competition consists of 4
                    categories: Regular, College, Open and Soccer. Regular and Open categories consist of three age
                    groups: Elementary, Junior High and Senior High. It is based on the idea that students from all over the world
                    should have the opportunity to meet with other students to develop creativity, design and problem solving
                    skills through challenging and educational robot competitions and activities.<br><br>
                    The 2015 Regular Junior High challenge 'Treasure Hunt' required a robot to autonomously navigate around an
                    unknown region finding and collecting good artefacts while staying safe and away from the invalid artefacts. Our
                    robot solved the coordinate system with its wonderful sense of coordinates and direction, and ended back in the
                    start area earning full points.<br><br>

                    FIRST LEGO League is an international competition organized for middle school students.
                    Each August, FIRST LEGO League introduces a scientific and real-world challenge for teams to focus and
                    research on. The robotics part of the competition involves desigining and programming LEGO Mindstorms robots to
                    complete tasks. The students work out solutions to the various problems they are given and then meet for
                    tournaments to share their knowledge, compare ideas, and display their robots. <br><br>
                    Trash Trek, the 2015-16 theme of the FIRST LEGO Challenge focused on improving the current way of trash
                    management. The robot game involved some tasks such as cleaning up plastic bags, using methane from a landfill
                    to power factories and transport and sort waste, among other tasks. <br><br>
                    Our robot 'Bolt' (later 'Bolt 2.O') was simple and sleek yet swift and efficient. Our entire run was spaced out
                    with maximum time utilization and minimum base time. Our project focused on improving trash collection and then
                    making a high-quality fertilizer out of biodegradable waste and to use non-biodegradable waste as polymer
                    fibres.<br>

                    The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition for young people. The 2016 season, Rap the Scrap, is to be held in Delhi, India in November 2016. The Indian chapter began from October, with the Delhi-NCR Regionals being the opening tournament of the season. This year saw an immense increase in the number of teams, trying to figure out a way of solving a much more complex challenge- Waste Sorting. <br><br>
                    The 2016 Regular Junior High challenge 'Waste Sorting' requires a robot to autonomously identify and locate the different types of wastes (denoted by cubes of different sizes and colours) found inside the house, and take them to their respective bins, to sort the waste. The challenge requires locating the different bins available for sorting (also differentiated by colors, and location), identifying different wastes available, and matching the wastes to their respective bins using an algorithm. Finally, to score points, the robot needs to pick the wastes, deposit them in the bins, and return to the start area (the house).<br><br>

                    FIRST Tech Challenge is a global, robotics competition for students in grades 9-12. FTC Teams are responsible for planning, building and programming their robots in a 3-month build period to compete in an alliance format against other teams. Teams are also required to make an 'Engineering Notebook' that documents their build season and experience.<br><br>
                    Velocity Vortex, the 2016-17 edition of the FIRST Tech Challenge, requires a robot to perform a variety of different tasks. The match begins with a 30 second autonomous period, where the robots can only operate by pre-programmed instructions. In this period, points are awarded if the robot presses the correct beacon buttons, successfully shoots 'particles' (balls) into designated areas and/or parks on a ramp or raised platform. The autonomous period is followed by a 2 minute driver-controlled period, where points are awarded if the robot shoots particles into the designated areas and/or lifts a 'cap ball' (gym ball). <br><br>
                    Our robot features a holonomic drivetrain for increased maneuverability, a flicker for quickly and effectively launching the particles and a mechanism for pressing the correct beacon buttons.<br><br>
