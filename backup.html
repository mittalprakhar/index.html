                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <img>
                <p>Hey there! I am Prakhar Mittal, I was born in a town called Saharanpur in India, on 26th May 2002; and as you might guess- I am 15 years old. I attend Delhi Public School, in Gurgaon, where I am living since the past ten years. Since a young age, I enjoyed tackling challenges and had a passion for pursuing my interests. I spend quite a lot of time working on my computer: surfing the Internet, watching videos, following my favourite topics, trying out new programming languages and making short films. 

                <p>I am told I excel in studies, even when I am always busy in pursuing my hobbies. I have been learning to play the piano since I was seven and am scheduled to appear for Trinity College London's Grade 8 Exam. In my free time, I listen to songs, and play them on my piano, or compose my own music using Logic Pro. Moreover, I love playing with my camera and learning fancy film-editing skills on Final Cut Pro. Web development is another one of my several interests. 

                <p>I became a part of Team High Voltage, where I was exposed to the world of STEM education. We participated in World Robot Olympiad 2015, which helped me to learn communication and teamworking skills. In the FIRST LEGO League season, I was introduced to the mechanical aspect of building a robot, which was one sphere where I originally lacked. FLL provided me with the opportunity of interacting with people across the globe and express my opinions in front of others, while improving my leadership and problem identification skills.

                <p>The highlight of my journey in the field of robotics was when my team bounced back from a failed run to get a fullscore in the final run of WRO 2016. We finished second at the international event and bagged the Silver Medal for our country.

                    The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition for young people. The 2016 season, Rap the Scrap, was held in Delhi, India in November 2016. The Indian chapter began from October, with the Delhi-NCR Regionals being the opening event of the season.
                    <p>The 2016 Regular Junior High challenge 'Waste Sorting' requires a robot to autonomously identify and locate the different types of wastes (denoted by cubes of different sizes and colours) found inside the house, and take them to their respective bins, to sort the waste. The challenge requires locating the different bins available for sorting (also differentiated by colors and location), identifying different wastes available, and matching the wastes to their respective bins using an algorithm. Finally, to score points, the robot needs to pick the wastes, deposit them in the bins, and return to the start area.

                    FIRST Tech Challenge is a global, robotics competition for students in grades 9-12. FTC teams are responsible for planning, building and programming their robots in a 3-month build period to compete in an alliance format against other teams. Teams are also required to make an 'Engineering Notebook' that documents their build season and experience.
                    <p>Velocity Vortex, the 2016-17 edition of the FIRST Tech Challenge, required a robot to perform a variety of different tasks. The match began with an autonomous period, where the robots could only operate by pre-programmed instructions. The autonomous period was followed by a driver-controlled period, where points were awarded if the robot shot particles into the designated areas. Our robot featured a holonomic drivetrain for increased maneuverability, a flicker for quickly and effectively launching the particles and a mechanism for pressing the correct beacon buttons.

                    FIRST Lego League is an international competition organized for middle school students. The robotics part of the competition involves desigining and programming LEGO Mindstorms robots to complete tasks. The students work out solutions to the various problems they are given and then meet for tournaments to share their knowledge, compare ideas, and display their robots.
                    <p>Trash Trek, the 2015-16 theme, focused on improving the current way of trash management. The robot game involved some tasks such as cleaning up plastic bags, using methane from a landfill to power factories and transport and sort waste, among other tasks. Our robot 'Bolt was simple and sleek yet swift and efficient. Our project focused on improving trash collection and then making a high-quality fertilizer out of biodegradable waste and to use non-biodegradable waste as polymer fibres.

                    The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition for young people. First held in 2004 in Singapore, it now attracts more than 20,000 teams from nearly 60 countries. The competition consists of 4 categories: Regular, College, Open and Soccer. It is based on the idea that students from all over the world should have the opportunity to meet with other students to develop creativity, design and problem solving skills through challenging and educational robot competitions and activities.

                    <p>The 2015 Regular Junior High challenge 'Treasure Hunt' required a robot to autonomously navigate around an unknown region finding and collecting good artefacts while staying safe and away from the invalid artefacts. Our robot solved the coordinate system with its wonderful sense of coordinates and direction, and ended back in the start area earning full points.
